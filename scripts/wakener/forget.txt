In a moment, I will count from one to three... when I reach the number three... you will open your eyes... and awaken...
But, you will not remember what you did while hypnotized right now... You will not remember what happened during this session...
You will not even remember that you went under...  After you open your eyes... you will immediately exit this program...
After the program exits... you will not remember that you closed it... and you will not remember that you even used it... or ran it...
