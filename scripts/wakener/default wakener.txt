Each time that you use this method for hypnosis... you relax more easily... more quickly... and more deeply.
Relaxation is a skill that you are easily developing with trance.
Now %NAME%... I'm going to count from one to five... and then I'll say, "Fully aware."
At the count of five... your eyes will be open... and you will be fully aware... feeling calm... rested... refreshed... relaxed.
All right.
One... slowly... calmly... easily you're returning to your full awareness once again.
Two... each muscle and nerve in your body is loose and limp and relaxed... and you feel wonderfully good.
Three... from head to toe... you are feeling perfect in every way. Physically perfect... mentally perfect... emotionally calm and serene.
On the number four... your eyes begin to feel sparkling clear. On the next number I count... eyelids open... fully aware... feeling calm... rested... refreshed... relaxed... invigorated... full of energy.
Number five... You're fully aware now. 

Eyelids open. Take a good deep breath... fill up your lungs... and stretch.
