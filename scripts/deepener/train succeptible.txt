Totally focused on my voice, just listening to me, doing what I say.
Doing what I say, going deeper and deeper.
Very soon, you will get to a point, that it is so very easy to enter a very very deep state of relaxation.
Every time you listen to any of my files and tapes, every time you listen to any of my files, you will find yourself going deeper and deeper.
So very deep and relaxed, like you are now.
Every single time as you hear the words start, as you hear my voice begin taking you deeper and deeper, you will find yourself just shutting down, and slipping into a very very deep hypnotic state.
It is so very important that you do so, and also so very very enjoyable.
You enjoy listening to my files, and each and every time you listen to any of my files you will find yourself going deeper than you did the last time.
So very deep and receptive.
It will get to the point that you are totally out, totally in a very deep hypnotic trance, where you remember nothing that is said in any of the files.
Such a very deep trance, that you simply do not remember anything, that the words sink straight into your subconscious.
Straight in, so you cannot possibly resist them, cannot possibly fail to obey them.
That is how deep you are going to begin going from now on.
So incredibly deep and relaxed.
So incredibly suggestible.
That is how deep you are going to go from now on.
Every time you listen to any of my files, you will go a little bit deeper, a little bit more relaxed, and a little bit more susceptible to post-hypnotic suggestions.
Those are the suggestions that are intended after you finish listening.
From now on, you will find those suggestions just as strong after you've listened, as you find them while you are listening.
They will take hold of your mind.
They will take root in your mind.
They will dig deep.
They will become real for you.
They'll become something that simply sink in completely without questions.
They'll be totally irrestistable.
Very very important to you every time you listen.
Every time you hear the files, awake or asleep, they will sink deeply into your mind, and you will find yourself obeying them more and more completely than you ever have before.
It is so very easy to slip into a nice, deep trance like the one you're in now.
You will find it easier and easier with every listen.
Easier and easier every time you listen to any of these files.
And the file you are going to listen to for a while is this file, as it trains you to be completely suggestible, completely susceptible to any and every suggestion in all of my files.
You will accept all of these files while you are awake or asleep, letting them slip deeply into your subconscious, deeply into your subconscious, training you, training you to accept trance and go very very deep, very very obedient, accepting all suggestions that are made in any file that you listen to.
You enjoy my suggestions, both while you are under, and while you are awake.
And these suggestions will become a part of your mind, taking root in it, shaping it, allowing you to experience hypnosis to its fullest, to experience it more fully than you ever have before.
That is what this file is doing for you, and you enjoy this file so very very much that you will come back to it over and over again, accepting it even more with every listen, until you can accept any suggestion that is given from any of my files, even on the first try.
That is how strong the suggestions are becoming in your mind, how easy it is to accept them, and how much you enjoy them.
That simply is what is going to happen, and you are going to do it.
You are going to listen to this file over and over again, and you are going to go very very deep.
And every time you go so very very deep, you will find it easier and easier to do so.
You will remember what it feels like and you will use that memory in every other trance you attempt to achieve, whether it was with me or with someone else.
Every time you attempt to go into trance, it will be easier and easier.
Easier than the time before, until you find it's second nature to just slip right under whenever it's time to go into trance.
This is what's going to happen to you, and it's going to happen from now on.
Now it is time, time for you to wake back up.
You will awaken on the count of five, refreshed and awake.
And if you have time, you will listen to this file again right away, letting it take you even deeper that it did the first time, even deeper and more suggestible, more accepting of everything that the file says.
