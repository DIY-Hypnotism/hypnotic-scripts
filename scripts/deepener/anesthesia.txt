Now I want you to do something for me.
I want you to imagine... that you are now breathing odourless anaesthesia...
Every time you breathe in... your body gets very... very relaxed.
Have a nice deep breath now... and inhale this anaesthesia.

You can now feel all your body... starting to get limp... and relaxed.
Have another deep breath...
[[slnc 2000]]
Your body is getting all numb and loose. 
Have yet another deep breath... 
[[slnc 2000]]
You notice that it is getting difficult to think... and that all you can do is have deep breaths and relax...
It is getting very... very hard to think now... and your body is completely relaxed...
Each time you breathe your mind gets cloudier, and cloudier...
It seems like your mind... is very... very sleepy...
Feel your mind get more... and more... sleepy...
It is so nice... and calm...
All you will do now is listen to my voice and relax.
Have another deep breath
[[slnc 2000]]
Not needing to think at all, just listen to me...
This time you are two times more relaxed.
And each time you breathe in... your relaxation will double...
I am going to count down from ten to one... 
When I reach one... you will be completely deep and relaxed...
10... you are now... beginning to get very deep.
9... With each number... you get deeper... and deeper...
8... Relaxing totally... mind and body completely numb...
7... listening to me... relaxing more and more...
6... 
5... giving up control completely... more and more...
4... Listening to my voice relaxes you, more... and more... 
3... just listening to my voice... and relaxing...
2... almost completely in trance...
1... you are now completely deep and relaxed...
