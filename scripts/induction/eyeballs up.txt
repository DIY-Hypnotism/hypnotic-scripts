Just sit and relax. 
Now we are going to use our imagination.
In other words... let us close your eyes and imagine a scene...
Visualize a scene and see it in front of your eyes...
Now let us test your imagination in a few ways...
I will describe what I want you to visualize... and you will visualize it....
All right... close your eyelids down and imagine you are standing in front of your car...
Now when you see it very clearly... just nod your head...
Looking at your car... noticing the color of your car...
Open the door of the car and get in behind the wheel...
Now look straight ahead...
Is the speedometer in the center or to your right or to your left?
Is the speedometer circular... semi-circular... horizontal or vertical?
What color is the needle that indicates the speed on the speedometer?
I hope you could see all that clearly...
Now let us test your imagination in another way...
We learned a couple of things about your imagination right then...
You have a good imagination to create... because in that instance I asked you something where you had to create a picture and notice the details in the picture...
Now we will find out how well you can imagine a simple... single object...
This time imagine that you are looking at a full moon...
Imagine that you are either seated outside or in a car... or at the beach... or maybe looking out your bedroom window...
It is night time and you are looking up at a full moon...
To help you to see the full moon... I want you to now to roll your eyeballs back up... with you eyelids remaining closed down...
Roll your eyeballs back up in your head as if you could see the full moon right up in the center of your forehead...
Roll your eyeballs way back up in your head and as you do your eyelids lock tightly closed... the more you try to open them the tighter they are locking closed... try now to open your eyelids... they're locking tighter and tighter... now stop trying... just relax and SLEEP...
Let a good and pleasant feeling now come all over your body....
Let every muscle and nerve in your body go limp and loose...
Breathe easily and deeply and send a wave of deep relaxation from the top of your head to the tips of your toes...
