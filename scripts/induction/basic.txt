Now feel yourself become twice as relaxed... twice as deep... just let go...
Turn loose now... relax...
Let a good... pleasant feeling come all across your body...
Let every muscle and every nerve grow so loose and so limp... and so relaxed...
Arms limp now... just like a rag doll...
That's good...
Now... send a pleasant wave of relaxation over your entire body... from the top of your head... to the tips of your toes...
Just let every muscle and nerve grow loose... and limp... and relaxed...
You are feeling more relaxed with each easy breath that you take...
Droopy... drowsy... and sleepy...
So calm... and so relaxed...
You relax more with each easy beat of your heart...
with each easy breath that you take...
with each sound that you hear...
relax..
