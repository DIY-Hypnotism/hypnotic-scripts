You are aware of everything... and yet you are not aware...
You are listening with your subconscious mind... while your conscious mind is far away... and not listening...
Your conscious mind is far away... and not listening...
Your subconscious mind is awake... and listening... and hearing everything while your conscious mind remains very relaxed and peaceful...
You can relax peacefully because your subconscious mind is taking charge... and when this happens... you close your eyes and let your subconscious do all the listening...
Your subconscious mind knows...
and because your subconscious mind knows...
your conscious mind does not need to know... and can stay asleep...
and not mind while your subconscious mind stays wide awake...
You have much potential in your subconscious mind which you lack in your conscious mind...
You can remember everything that has happened with your subconscious mind
but you cannot remember everything with your conscious mind...
You can forget so easily...
and with forgetting certain things you can remember other things...
Remembering what you need to remember... and forgetting what you can forget...
It does not matter if you forget... you need not remember...
Your subconscious mind remembers everything that you need to know... and you can let your subconscious mind listen and remember while your conscious mind sleeps and forgets...
Just listen with your subconscious mind... and when you're listening very... very carefully... your head can now nod yes...
As you continue to listen to me... with your subconscious mind...
your conscious mind sleeps deeper and deeper... and deeper... and deeper...
Let your conscious mind stay deeply asleep...
and let your subconscious mind listen to me...
