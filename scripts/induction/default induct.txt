%NAME%... I want you to stare at the hypnotic image.
Fix your eyes on it.
Take a few deep breaths.
Just keep breathing deeply.
Listen to the sound of my voice %NAME%.
You will find that your eyelids have a tendency to get heavy.
Almost as if they had heavy weights attached to them.
And the longer you stare at this %NAME%... the more your eyelids get heavy... and you blink... and they have a feeling like something is pulling them down...
as if they wanted to slowly close... and get drowsier and sleepier and heavier.
And you have a feeling as if they were slowly closing... slowly closing... getting drowsier and more tired... and when they finally do close... how good you'll feel.
Drowzy... heavy... pulling down... down... down... slowly closing... getting harder and harder to see... and you feel good %NAME%.
Very... very hard to keep them open... feel that very soon they will close tightly... almost tightly closing... almost tightly closing... tightly closing.
Your eyes are tightly closed... you feel good... you feel comfortable... you're relaxed all over... %NAME%... just let yourself drift and enjoy this comfortable relaxed state.
You will find that your head will get heavier... tends to nod forward some... and you just let yourself drift in an easy... calm... relaxed state.
