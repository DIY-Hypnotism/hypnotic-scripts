I just want you to sit back, and begin focusing on my words...
Just start focusing on what I am saying [[slnc 500]]
listen to my soothing voice...[[slnc 500]]
Notice how my voice starts to relax you
as you begin breathing deeply for me... [[slnc 500]]
Take a deep breath in [[slnc 1000]]
and let it out slowly....[[slnc 1000]]
Another deep breath in [[slnc 1000]]
and let it out very slowly... [[slnc 2000]]
Feeling yourself begin to sink down.
Becoming more and more relaxed with every word I say...
Whenever you feel your mind wandering
just easily bring your attention back to my soothing voice
and listen to what I have to say...
Taking in every word...
relaxing with every word...
Feeling yourself starting to relax...
and let go... [[slnc 250]]
just feel yourself letting go [[slnc 250]]
it's very easy to let yourself go... [[slnc 250]]
Down and down...
relaxing more and more...
feeling yourself drop more and more with each word I say...
and with each breath you take...
enjoying the feeling of deep relaxation.
Let your mind go...
just let your mind take a break now...
you don't need to analyze what is going on...
analyzing is too hard...
it feels much better to just relax...
and not analyze...
it's much more relaxing to follow what I say...
instead of thinking...
thinking feels too hard to do...
it feels so hard...
Just drift and relax...
it feels so good to just drift and relax...
no need to care about anything else...
just letting everything relax you...
every feeling you have, every breath you take, every word I say relaxes you...
relaxes you...
so[[slnc 400]]very[[slnc 400]]sleepy...
so comfortable...
just feeling wonderful...
so passive...
no need to worry about anything...
just relax...
relax...
relax...
