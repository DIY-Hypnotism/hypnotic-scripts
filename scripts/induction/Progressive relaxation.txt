Ok %NAME%, close your eyes and just relax...
become aware of you breathing... 
notice that it become regular... 
and slow... 
just slow... 
and regular... 
and deep. 
I want you to concentrate on my voice... 
and only on my voice 
and if other sounds or thoughts intrude in your mind, just ignore it... 
let it go... 
just allow my voice to soothe... 
and relax you... 
I want you to take you mind down... 
down to the muscles of your feet... 
and ankles... 
concentrate in muscles your feet and ankles... 
and just let them relax... 
let them go... 
let them go limp... 
and slack... 
and loose... 
and relaxed...
