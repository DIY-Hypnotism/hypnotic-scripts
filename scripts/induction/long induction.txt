Just make yourself comfortable %NAME%... and close your eyes now.
just separate your hands... and let them lie loosely in your lap... or by your sides, if that's more comfortable.
it's better if your legs are uncrossed... but it doesn't matter if you feel you need to move just slightly... now and again.
you don't have to be absolutely still... just be comfortable and relax the whole body as much as you can.
now %NAME% I want you to take a deep breath... and hold it for a moment before breathing out slowly.
just allowing your whole body to relax as you do so.
and I want you to keep your eyes closed now... and just keep listening quietly to the sound of my voice.
you'll be aware of other sounds, too.
sounds inside the building... sounds from outside... maybe passing traffic.
but these won't disturb you... in fact... they'll help to relax you...
because just for now the world outside is absolutely unimportant to you.
The only sound you're interested in %name% is the sound of my voice...
and while you're listening to the sound of my voice... I want you to concentrate for a moment on your breathing.
breathing slowly... and steadily... and evenly.
just as if you were trying to convince somebody that you were absolutely sound asleep.
and as you breathe out each time
just allowing your whole body to relax more and more
so that you gradually find yourself... feeling as if your whole body was sinking further... and further... into the chair
with each breath you breathe
and while you're listening to the sound of my voice... you can just simply allow yourself to be as lazy as you could ever want to be.
Just allow yourself to be as lazy as you could ever want to be.
Good %name%.
now... while you're relaxing there in the chair... you can just be aware of your body...
aware of your hands where they rest on the arms of the chair...
Perhaps noticing the angle of your elbows... and maybe sensing the weight of your head against the chair back.
and... you know... that weight might seem to just gently increase... as you allow yourself to relax more and more.
just being aware of your ankles and feet now... on the footrest... and wondering if they will start to feel heavy too
as you...
relax...
thinking about your breathing for a few moments...
noticing that your breathing is becoming slower... and steadier... as you relax more... and more...
slower... and steadier...
breathing so steadily... and evenly...
just as though you were pretending to be sound asleep...
breathing so evenly... so steadily...
you almost wouldn't disturb a feather placed immediately in front of you...
breathing so easily... and slowly...
so gently... that you almost wouldn't disturb even a single... strand... of a feather
placed right in front of you...
And as you allow yourself to relax even more now %name%... I wonder if you can perhaps sense the beating of your own heart.
sensing the beat of your own heart... and just seeing whether you can use the power of your mind... to slow that heartbeat down...
just a touch... just seeing whether you can use the power of your mind...
to slow that heartbeat down... just a little...
so that you can then feel your whole body slowing down...
becoming lazier and lazier...
because you've got absolutely nothing whatsoever to do... except to relax now...
nobody wanting anything... nobody expecting anything...
so you can allow your whole body... to continue to relax... and become steadier and easier until it's just ticking over.
like a well-maintained machine of some sort or another...
just ticking over...
smoothly...
easily...
quietly...
comfortably...
so that you can become gradually more aware of your whole self...
aware of your hands and arms... just sensing how they are now...
aware of your legs and feet... too...
again just sensing how relaxed they might be... and wondering if it's possible... to relax them even more...
to be so in touch with yourself... that you can actually get your whole body
perhaps... to relax even more...
yet remaining totally alert %name%...
and noticing now how even your face muscles can begin to really relax...
relaxing and letting go of the tensions that were there...
almost... but not quite... completely unnoticed...
just being vaguely aware of the skin... and the muscles of your face settling...
smoothing out...
a good feeling...
wondering just how long all that tension had been there...
where it all came from in the first place...
and then realising that you simply couldn't care less...
because you can feel it draining away from you now...
and that feels good...
and as you continue to sense the beating of your heart... and the absolute steadiness of your body's rhythm...
you wonder at the fact that you are so absolutely relaxed and comfortable... that you simply can't be bothered to even try to move even one single muscle...
even though you know you easily could... if you wanted to...
I know that you easily could... if you wanted to...
but you simply can't be bothered to even try...
allowing yourself to just be...
relaxed... and relaxing even more now...
as lazy... and relaxed... as anyone could ever wish to be...
and I wonder if you can now manage to relax even more...
even though you are already as relaxed as it is possible for most people to ever be...
just finding the last tiny traces of tension in your body... and simply letting them go...
with each easy... gentle... breath you breathe...
allowing every muscle... every fibre...
every cell of your entire body...
to be as beautifully relaxed as anyone could ever wish to be...
